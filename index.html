        This company is truly fantastic! Tim is incredibly knowledgeable about plants and flowers and did an amazing job sprucing up the landscaping at the front of our house with low maintenance, beautiful bushes and flowers. He went above and beyond, taking time to make sure everything was perfect. With those changes and with equally thorough weekly mowing and maintenance of our lawn, Tim and his crew have taken our house from eyesore of the neighborhood to yard of the month on our street in just a few short months.
